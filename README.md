# Mahou Shoujo Monogatari DEMO
A repository for my Java indie game, Mahou Shoujo Monogatari for version control purposes.

## About This Project
This is a project that is derived from source code provided by the user RyiSnow <a href = "www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow">(youtube.com/@RyiSnow)</a>. This is mostly created from code found in his How To Make a 2D Game in Java series with some additional modifications I added to test things out and try to make a more unique project. If you'd like, you can use my source code as an example, but I ask that you credit both myself and RyiSnow if you do use it in any way, shape or form! c:
